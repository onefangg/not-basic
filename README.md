# Not-Basic

## Description

A Chrome extension for all our fellow basic girlies who need to be discouraged from buying basic clothes. Resist that stereotype that all Singapore girls dress the same!

The price of items flash rainbow in an annoying fashion, with the intention to make shopping on such basic clothing sites more annoying.
